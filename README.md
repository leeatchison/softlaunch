# Soft Launch

Soft Launch is a mechanism that allows you to add new features to a website, but limit which of your users has access to them. This allows you to give access to a new feature to a limited set of users,
while at the same time letting them try out the new feature in a full production environment.

Note: Soft Launch should not be used to enable unstable or untested features. It's purpose isn't to replace the normal testing process. It's purpose is to provide limited exposure to a set
of features before making them more globally available to everyone using your application.

# Installation

Soft Launch requires Rails 3.1 or greater.
Add this to your Gemfile and run the bundle command:

```ruby
